Topstar-related tests, and their problems.

* emit00
  - decription: just emit, which calls step and enque
* hasNext00
  - description: has iterator methods that call emit
* hasNext01
  - description: seems like emit00, but with longer identifiers
* hasNext02
  - description: seems like hasNext01, but with longer identifiers
* test11
  - description: handwritten; has state but no registers
  - status: FAILS to infer specs for 2 out of 3 procedures
* test12
  - description: a smaller version of test11
  - status: OK
* test13
  - description: a smaller version of test12 and of test14
  - status: OK
* test14
  - description: one step, from "a" to "b" or "c"
  - status: OK
* test15
  - description: two steps, a->b and b->c
  - status: FAILS to infer specs
* test16
  - description: like test15, but inconsistent because it disallows mutation
  - status: doesn't to infer specs
      (any inferred spec would be correct, although undesirable)
* test17
  - description: handwritten emit (step and check)
  - status: OK
* test19
  - description: handwritten, uses one register (enque&compare with const)
  - status: FAILS to infer specs for emit
* test20
  - description: angelic vs demonic splits
  - status: CORRECT
    however, the precondition is a disjunciton with many branches out of which
    only one is consistent; the others should be pruned
* test21
  - description: synthesized from automaton, words up to length 4 with 3 letters
* test22
  - description: like test21, but with words of length only up to 2
  - status: FAILS on some cases, works on others
* test23
  - description: test that disjunction in post is carried over by inference
  - status: OK
* test24
  - description: handwritten automaton with 2 registers, tested on 3 words
* test25
  - description: test that inferred specs take into account returned arg
  - status: OK
