The coreStar Verification Framework
===================================

coreStar is a highly-customisable automatic generic core symbolic execution 
engine for analysis and verification with separation logic.

For more information, see http://www.jstarverifier.org



Building on *nix / Mac OSX / Cygwin
-----------------------------------

Use the standard incantation.
  ./configure --prefix DIR
  make install

(NOTE: In some environments, such as Mac OS Leopard, dynlink.cmxa is
unavailable, leading to a compile error. In that case, try "make install.byte".)

And then run, assuming DIR/bin is in your path.
  corestar

Optionally, run the tests to make sure all is OK.
  make test
