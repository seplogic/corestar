- fix infer_tests/test15.star
- the test-suite doesn't automatically catch errors! any easy fix?
- fix the printing of star: has too many newlines
- use Z3 to help with instantiating lvars that occur only in conclusion
- make it faster
- test on problem similar to those of topstar
- disjunctions in preconditions should probably lead to splitting the triple
- do some sensible checking for the "instantiations" claimed while checking
  (this is a soundness problem!)
- add "without" side-conditions
- port old tests
- add location to AST elements (CFG/rules/...)
- Prover.abduce_instance_rule can produce a number of goals exponential in the number of lvars on the RHS
- use Prover.normalize only for formulas we have no control over (eg,
  user-provided, or after a Z3.Expr.simplify), and have another, less
  costly "normalize_internal" that takes internal invariants into
  account (eg, no || below || as we are careful to use only the n-ary
  version). This is warranted because normalize is called all the time.
- eliminate garbage logical variables in the states
- better location reporting for syntax errors; sometimes, they are a bit off
- well-formedness checks for specs "{P}(M){Q} [FA<-AA] returns [FR<-AR]"
  - FA and FR are (lists of) local variables
  - AR is a list of variables (*not* arbitrary terms) -- enforcable by grammar
  - FA may occur in P but not in M or Q
  - FR may occur in Q but not in M or P
