(* By definition a sequent holds when ((h * f) -> (c * f)) is a valid formula.
NOTE: Any free variable is interpreted as a free variable in the above formula.
For example, if x is free in some of h, f, c, then the sequent is valid when
âˆ€x((h * f) -> (c * f)), because a formula is valid when its closure is valid. *)

(** The subgoal list represents a conjunction.

    The goal often has the form (L*?l |- R*?r): L and R contain the
    interesting part, while the pattern variables ?l and ?r capture
    the rest.

    pure_check is a list of pure formulas that should all hold for the
    rule to fire (it is passed to the SMT solver, which checks that
    they are valid).

    fresh_in_expr is a list of pairs (v,e) such that v must not appear
    free in e for the rule to fire.
