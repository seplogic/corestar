(*
 * Debug helpers. The code of coreStar supports debugging in two ways. First, by
 * setting [safe] mode (possibly expensive) sanity checks are run. (There is no
 * reason to ever turn off cheap sanity checks.) Second, the code is
 * interspersed with dumps of various state information. For logging, however,
 * there can't be only one control that turns it on or off, because that would
 * be confusing. For example, if the programmer suspects a bug in the proof
 * search, then messages that describe how symbolic execution proceeds are
 * distracting garbage.  Hence, logging is split into categories, and each
 * subset of categories may be turned on at a time. As with sanity checks,
 * logging may be expensive, so the messages for categories that are turned off
 * are not even constructed (rather than being constructed but not printed).
 *
 * When sanity check or logging is turned off, the compiler throws away the
 * corresponding debugging code completely. That is why the on/off controls are
 * immutable and why bit-masks are used instead of fancier data structures like
 * lists.
 *
 * Guidelines for sanity checks. Expensive sanity (invariant) checks should
 * typically be put in functions starting with "check_". Then they should be
 * called by using the laziness of the if statement and that of boolean and.
 *    if safe then check_inv data
 * The checking function is suposed to raise an exception or to assert if a
 * problem is detected.
 *
 * Guidelines for logging. The typical logging code is
 *    if log log_category then
 *      fprintf logf "Some message.@\n"
 * assuming that modules Debug and Format are open. Note that each log message
 * starts by opening a box ("@[") and finishes by flushing, closing boxes and
 * going to a new line ("@."). The first complication that may appear is that
 * a message belongs not to one log_category but to several log categories
 * log_a, log_b, and log_c.
 *    if log_active land (log_a lor log_b lor log_c) <> 0 then
 *      fprintf logf "Some message.@\n"
 * The second complication is that the message might be long.
 *    if log log_category then
 *      fprintf logf "@[<2>Some message with@ break hints.@]@\n"
 * Finally, to dump big data structures use %a.
 *    if log log_category then
 *      fprintf logf "@[<2>Here's a foo:%a@]@\n" print_function data
 * Note that while printing a hierarchical structure it is usually convenient to
 * (1) force a newline "@\n", (2) open a box and prepare the indent for the
 * children "@[<2>", (3) print some data, (4) recursively print the children
 * using %a, and (5) close the box "@]". Boxes should typically be opened only
 * after "@\n". A data type X should have a pretty printing function
 *    pp_X : X Corestar_std.pretty_printer
 *
 * Opening Format should make it less likely to mix Format with Printf.
 *
 * Wrap the main function with
 *    fprintf logf "@["; ...; fprintf logf "@]@?"
 *
 * Finally, don't forget that guidelines are meant to be broken.
